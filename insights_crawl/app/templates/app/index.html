        <h2>Facts</h2>
        <p>
            They survey data is interpreted to derive facts and norms. A <em>Fact</em> expresses a survey Q&A as a percentile; the response of the
            respondents to this Q&A compared to the total number of respondents. In case of a boolean response (no/yes), the response value
            is a 0 or 1. For a nominal response, the response value is normalized between 0 and 1.
            These Facts can be computed for the whole population, but it is also possible to compute these Facts for sub-groups of respondents.
            These sub-groups corresponds to Facets that characterize respondents such as Age group, Gender, Country.
            Having different Fact values for these sub-groups results into <em>Norms</em>. What are the average Fact values for the different groups
            and where do you see patterns or correlations.

            with all of its content, is first deleted. Next the Index is created with a field for each facet that is defined for the
            connected site(s).
